## Gameplay
BATTLEFISH is a Battleship-inspired widget game that follows the hijinks of an illegal fish smuggler. There are two chapters, each with different takes on the Battleship format.
Chapter 1 is for fast-paced gameplay, as you only have 40 bullets to kill your supply of illegal fish before your operation is busted and you're arrested. 
Chapter 2 is accessed after completion of Chapter 1 (though you can opt out of playing the longer chapter) and is about a rival fish smuggler's attempt to kill your entire inventory. Kill his first so you aren't driven to bankruptcy!
